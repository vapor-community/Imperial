# Federated Login with Auth0

We need to start by creating a regular web application so Auth0 can identify us.  Go to the Applications menu from the side-bar on your Auth0 Dashboard.

Select '+ Create Application'.  Provide a name for your app and select 'Regular Web Applications'.  Then select 'Create'.

Go to the 'Settings' tab for your application to find your Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret.

You'll want to configure this is a "Regular Web Application" using "POST" for the Token Endpoint Authentication Method.

Be sure to configure the proper settings for:
 - Allowed Callback URLs
 - Application Login URI
 - Allowed Web Origins
 - Allowed Logout URLs

If testing on your local system, you can start with the following settings:

 - Allowed Callback URLs:
    - http://localhost:8080/login/callback, https://localhost/login/callback, https://127.0.0.1/login/callback
 - Application Login URI:
    - https://127.0.0.1/login
 - Allowed Web Origins:
    - http://localhost:8080/, https://localhost/, https://127.0.0.1/
 - Allowed Logout URLs:
    - http://localhost:8080/, https://localhost/, https://127.0.0.1/

Now that we have the necessary information for Auth0, we will setup Imperial with our application.

Add the following line of code to your `dependencies` array in your package manifest file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/Imperial.git", from: "0.14.0")
```

You will also need to add the package as a dependency for the targets you will be using it in:

```swift
.target(name: "App", dependencies: ["Vapor", "Imperial"]),
```

If using Xcode 11, then updating the Packages.swift is sufficient.  However, if
you're using the generated xcodeproj file, then run `vapor update` or `swift
package update` to regenerate the xcodeproj file.

If not already configured, be sure to add `SessionMiddleware` to our middleware configuration:

```swift
public func configure(
    _ config: inout Config,
    _ env: inout Environment,
    _ services: inout Services
) throws {
    //...

    // Register middleware
    var middlewares = MiddlewareConfig() // Create _empty_ middleware config
	// Other Middleware...
    middlewares.use(SessionsMiddleware.self)
    services.register(middlewares)
    
	//...
}

```

Now, when you run your app and you are using `FluentSQLite`, you will probably get the following error:

```
⚠️ [ServiceError.ambiguity: Please choose which KeyedCache you prefer, multiple are available: MemoryKeyedCache, FluentCache<SQLiteDatabase>.] [Suggested fixes: `config.prefer(MemoryKeyedCache.self, for: KeyedCache.self)`. `config.prefer(FluentCache<SQLiteDatabase>.self, for: KeyedCache.self)`.]
```

Just pick one of the listed suggestions and place it at the top of your `configure` function. If you want your data to persist across server reboots, use `config.prefer(FluentCache<SQLiteDatabase>.self, for: KeyedCache.self)`

Imperial uses environment variables to access the client ID and secret to authenticate with Google. To allow Imperial to access these tokens, you will create these variables, called `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`, with the domain, client ID, and secret assigned to them. Imperial can then access these vars and use there values to authenticate with Auth0.

Now, all we need to do is register the Auth0 service in your main router method, like this:


```swift
try router.oAuth(from: Auth0.self, authenticate: "login", callback: "http://localhost/login/callback", scope: ["profile"]) { (request, token) in
    print(token)
    return Future(request.redirect(to: "/"))
}
```

The `profile` scope will allow you to get more profile information about the user via the resulting access token.  Auth0 requires the `openid` scope, which will automatically be included for you.

If you just want to redirect, without doing anything else in the callback, you can use the helper `Route.oAuth` method that takes in a redirect string:

```swift
try router.oAuth(from: Auth0.self, authenticate: "login", callback: "http://localhost/login/callback", redirect: "/")
```

The `callback` argument is the path you will go to when you want to authenticate the user. The `callback` argument has to be one of the URLs you entered in the Allowed Callback URLs on your Auth0 dashboard.

The completion handler is fired when the callback route is called by the OAuth provider (Auth0). The access token is passed in and a response is returned.

If you ever want to get the `access_token` in a route, you can use a helper method for the `Request` type that comes with Imperial:

```swift
let token = try request.accessToken()
```

Now that you are authenticating the user, you will want to protect certain routes to make sure the user is authenticated. You can do this by adding the `ImperialMiddleware` to a router group (or maybe your middleware config):

```swift
let protected = router.grouped(ImperialMiddleware())
```

Then, add your protected routes to the `protected` group:

```swift
protected.get("me", handler: me)
```

The `ImperialMiddleware` by default passes the errors it finds onto `ErrorMiddleware` where they are caught, but you can initialize it with a redirect path to go to if the user is not authenticated:

```swift
let protected = router.grouped(ImperialMiddleware(redirect: "/"))
```

## Supporting SSL

Auth0 requires https for the Login URI.  However, Vapor 3 does not natively
support SSL.  To get by for local testing:

Generate certificates for your localhost by:

 - Installing [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
 - Run `mkcert -install`
 - Run `mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1`

Then create an nginx.conf file like so:

```
events {
  worker_connections  512;  ## Default: 1024
}

http {
    server {
        listen      443 ssl;
        server_name localhost;

        ssl_certificate        /path/to/localhost.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key    /path/to/localhost-key.pem;
        #ssl_client_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt;
        #ssl_verify_client      optional;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
        }
    }
}
```

Then run nginx like so:

```sh
# nginx -c $(pwd)/nginx.conf
```

nginx will now be running and listening to https (port 443) requests and
forwarding to your localhost port 8080, which your vapor app is listening on.

You can stop nginx by executing:

```sh
# killall nginx
```

## Authenticated Routes

You can require authenticated routes by adding these lines to your `routes()`:

```swift
    let protected = router.grouped(ImperialMiddleware())

    protected.get("members_only") { req -> Future<View> in
        return try req.view().render("hello")
    }
```

This will ensure that the /members_only path is accessible to authenticated users.  If an unauthenticated user hits this route, they will get a 401 error with a message like the following:

```text
    {"error":true,"reason":"User currently not authenticated"}
```

## Authenticated + Unauthenticated Routes

To allow a route to support both authenticated and unauthenticated users, you can add these lines to your `routes()`:

```swift
    router.get { req -> Future<View> in
        let view: String
        do {
            guard try req.accessToken() != "" else {
                throw Abort(.unauthorized, reason: "User currently not authenticated")
            }
            view = "welcome-auth"
        } catch let error as Abort where error.status == .unauthorized {
            view = "welcome"
        }
        return try req.view().render(view)
    }
```

This creates a route for "/".  If the access token is available (and not empty), it will present the "welcome-auth" view.  And if not available, it will present the "welcome" view.

## Logout

To support logout, you can create a route like so:

```swift
    let auth0 = try Auth0Auth()
    router.get("/logout") { req -> Response in
        let return_url = "https://localhost/"
        let logout_url = "https://\(auth0.domain)/v2/logout?client_id=\(auth0.clientID)&returnTo=\(return_url)"
        try req.destroySession()
        return req.redirect(to: logout_url)
    }
```

This route must exist on an unauthenticated route.  This is because the destroySession call will eliminate the session.  If you attempt to do this on a protected route, you will get an "unauthorized" error rather than the redirect.
