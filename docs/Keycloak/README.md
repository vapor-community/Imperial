# Federated Login with Keycloak

> The implementation may vary depending on your configuration

It's your first time with Keycloak? Check the [Started Guide][1].

- In your Keycloak realm, go to **Clients** and select or create a new client. The **ClientID** is the `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` value.
- Inside your client, go to **Credentials** and get the **Secret**, it's the `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`.


Now that we have the necessary information for Keycloak, we will setup Imperial with our application.

Add the following line of code to your `dependencies` array in your package manifest file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/Imperial.git", from: "0.12.0")
```

**Note:** There might be a later version of the package available, in which case you will want to use that version.

You will also need to add the package as a dependency for the targets you will be using it in:

```swift
.target(name: "App", dependencies: ["Vapor", "Imperial"],
               exclude: [
                   "Config",
                   "Database",
                   "Public",
                   "Resources"
               ]),
```

Then run `vapor update` or `swift package update`. Make sure you regenerate your Xcode project afterwards if you are using Xcode.

Now that Imperial is installed, we need to add `SessionMiddleware` to our middleware configuration:

```swift
public func configure(
    _ config: inout Config,
    _ env: inout Environment,
    _ services: inout Services
) throws {
    //...

    // Register middleware
    var middlewares = MiddlewareConfig() // Create _empty_ middleware config
	// Other Middleware...
    middlewares.use(SessionsMiddleware.self)
    services.register(middlewares)

	//...
}

```

Now, when you run your app and you are using `FluentSQLite`, you will probably get the following error:

```
⚠️ [ServiceError.ambiguity: Please choose which KeyedCache you prefer, multiple are available: MemoryKeyedCache, FluentCache<SQLiteDatabase>.] [Suggested fixes: `config.prefer(MemoryKeyedCache.self, for: KeyedCache.self)`. `config.prefer(FluentCache<SQLiteDatabase>.self, for: KeyedCache.self)`.]
```

Just pick one of the listed suggestions and place it at the top of your `configure` function. If you want your data to persist across server reboots, use `config.prefer(FluentCache<SQLiteDatabase>.self, for: KeyedCache.self)`

Imperial uses environment variables to access the client ID and secret to authenticate with Keycloak. To allow Imperial to access these tokens, you will create these variables, called `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID`, `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`, `KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` and `KEYCLOAK_AUTH_URL`, with the client ID and secret assigned to them. Imperial can then access these vars and use their values to authenticate with Keycloak.

In many case, `KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` have the current patern `http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/{realmName]/protocol/openid-connect/token` (but may vary if you use a proxy). And `KEYCLOAK_AUTH_URL` is generally `http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/{realmName}/protocol/openid-connect`.

Now, all we need to do is register the Keycloak service in your main router method, like this:

```swift
try router.oAuth(from: Keycloak.self, authenticate: "keycloak", callback: "http://localhost:8080/keycloak-complete") { (request, token) in
    print(token)
    return Future(request.redirect(to: "/"))
}
```

If you just want to redirect, without doing anything else in the callback, you can use the helper `Route.oAuth` method that takes in a redirect string:

```swift
try router.oAuth(from: Keycloak.self, authenticate: "keycloak", callback: "http://localhost:8080/keycloak-complete", redirect: "/")
```

The `callback` argument is the path you will go to when you want to authenticate the user. The `callback` argument has to be the same path that you entered when you registered your application on Keycloak:

![The callback path for Keycloak OAuth](https://github.com/vapor-community/Imperial/blob/master/docs/Keycloak/callback-uri.png?raw=true)

The completion handler is fired when the callback route is called by the OAuth provider. The access token is passed in and a response is returned.

If you ever want to get the `access_token` in a route, you can use a helper method for the `Request` type that comes with Imperial:

```swift
let token = try request.accessToken()
```

Now that you are authenticating the user, you will want to protect certain routes to make sure the user is authenticated. You can do this by adding the `ImperialMiddleware` to a router group (or maybe your middleware config):

```swift
let protected = router.grouped(ImperialMiddleware())
```

Then, add your protected routes to the `protected` group:

```swift
protected.get("me", handler: me)
```

The `ImperialMiddleware` by default passes the errors it finds onto `ErrorMiddleware` where they are caught, but you can initialize it with a redirect path to go to if the user is not authenticated:

```swift
let protected = router.grouped(ImperialMiddleware(redirect: "/"))
```
