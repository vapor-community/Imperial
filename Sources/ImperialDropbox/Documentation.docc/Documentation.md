# ``ImperialDropbox``

Federated Authentication with Dropbox for Vapor.

## Overview

### Dropbox Setup

Start by going to the [Dropbox App console page](https://dropbox.com/developers/apps/).
Click the `Create App` button. Choose your API, access type, and name, then click `Create App`:

![Create the app](create-application)

Fill in the rest of the app information, particularly the Redirect URIs:

![Redirect URI](callback-url)

This provides you with an OAuth Client ID and secret you can provide to Imperial.

### Imperial Integration

You can use Dropbox with the `ImperialDropbox` package. This expects two environment variables:

* `DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID`
* `DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET`

You can then register the OAuth provider like normal.
