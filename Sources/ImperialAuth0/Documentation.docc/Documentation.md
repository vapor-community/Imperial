# ``ImperialAuth0``

Federated Authentication with Auth0 for Vapor.

## Overview

### Auth0 Setup

We need to start by creating a regular web application so Auth0 can identify us.
Go to the Applications menu from the side-bar on your Auth0 Dashboard.

Select `+ Create Application`.
Provide a name for your app and select `Regular Web Applications`.
Then select `Create`.

Go to the `Settings` tab for your application to find your Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret.

You'll want to configure this is a "Regular Web Application" using "POST" for the Token Endpoint Authentication Method.

![Settings-2](SamplePortal-Settings-2)

Be sure to configure the proper settings for:
 - Allowed Callback URLs
 - Application Login URI
 - Allowed Web Origins
 - Allowed Logout URLs

If testing on your local system, you can start with the following settings:

 - Allowed Callback URLs:
    - http://localhost:8080/login/callback, https://localhost/login/callback, https://127.0.0.1/login/callback
 - Application Login URI:
    - https://127.0.0.1/login
 - Allowed Web Origins:
    - http://localhost:8080/, https://localhost/, https://127.0.0.1/
 - Allowed Logout URLs:
    - http://localhost:8080/, https://localhost/, https://127.0.0.1/

This provides you with an OAuth Client ID and secret you can provide to Imperial.

### Imperial Integration

You can use Auth0 with the `ImperialAuth0` package. This expects three environment variables:

* `AUTH0_DOMAIN`
* `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
* `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`

You can then register the OAuth provider like normal.
